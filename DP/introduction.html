                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p><em>Design patterns</em> are very popular among software developers. A design pattern is
                        a well-described solution to a common software problem.</p>
                    <p>Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Design patterns are already defined and provide an <em>industry-standard
                            approach</em> to solving a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly
                            use the design pattern. There are many Java design patterns that we can use in our
                            Java-based projects.
                        </li>
                        <li>Using design patterns promotes <em>reusability</em> that leads to more
                            <em>robust</em> and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing the total cost of
                            ownership (TCO) of the software product.
                        </li>
                        <li>Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and
                            debug. It leads to faster development and new members of the team understand it
                            easily.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Java design patterns are divided into three categories - <em>creational</em>,
                        <em>structural</em>, and <em>behavioral</em> design patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>This article serves as an index for all the Java design pattern articles.</p>
                    <h2>Creational Design Patterns</h2>
                    <p>Creational design patterns provide solutions to instantiate an <code>Object</code> in the
                        best possible way for specific situations.</p>
                    <h3>1. Singleton Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a <code>Class</code> and ensures
                        that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine. The
                        implementation of the singleton pattern has always been a controversial topic among
                        developers.</p>

                            Design Pattern</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>2. Factory Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple subclasses and
                        based on input, we need to return one of the subclasses. This pattern takes out the
                        responsibility of the instantiation of a <code>Class</code> from the client program to
                        the factory class. We can apply a singleton pattern on the factory class or make the
                        factory method <code>static</code>.</p>
                    <div class="callout note">

                    </div>
                    <h3>3. Abstract Factory
                        Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The abstract factory pattern is similar to the factory pattern and is a factory of
                        factories. If you are familiar with the factory design pattern in Java, you will notice
                        that we have a single factory class that returns the different subclasses based on the
                        input provided and the factory class uses <code>if-else</code> or <code>switch</code>
                        statements to achieve this. In the abstract factory pattern, we get rid of
                        <code>if-else</code> block and have a factory class for each subclass and then an
                        abstract factory class that will return the subclass based on the input factory class.
                    </p>

                            Factory Pattern</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>4. Builder Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The builder pattern was introduced to solve some of the problems with factory and
                        abstract Factory design patterns when the object contains a lot of attributes. This
                        pattern solves the issue with a large number of optional parameters and inconsistent
                        state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and provide a method that will
                        actually return the final <code>Object</code>.</p>
                    <div class="callout note">
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Learn more about the <a
                                href="../DP/builder.html">Builder Pattern</a>.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>5. Prototype Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The prototype pattern is used when the <code>Object</code> creation is costly and
                        requires a lot of time and resources, and you have a similar <code>Object</code> already
                        existing. So this pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original <code>Object</code>
                        to a new <code>Object</code> and then modify it according to our needs. This pattern
                        uses Java cloning to copy the <code>Object</code>. The prototype design pattern mandates
                        that the <code>Object</code> which you are copying should provide the copying feature.
                        It should not be done by any other class. However, whether to use the shallow or deep
                        copy of the object properties depends on the requirements and is a design decision.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Structural Design Patterns</h2>
                    <p>Structural design patterns provide different ways to create a <code>Class</code>
                        structure (for example, using inheritance and composition to create a large
                        <code>Object</code> from small <code>Objects</code>).
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Adapter Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The adapter design pattern is one of the structural design patterns and is used so that
                        two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object that joins these unrelated
                        interfaces is called an adapter.</p>

                        of a <code>Class</code>. Since every <code>Object</code> consumes memory space that can
                        be crucial for low-memory devices (such as mobile devices or embedded systems), the
                        flyweight design pattern can be applied to reduce the load on memory by sharing

                        At the same time, other instances of the same class will not be affected by this, so the
                        individual object gets the modified behavior. The decorator design pattern is one of the
                        structural design patterns (such as adapter pattern, bridge pattern, or composite
                        pattern) and uses abstract classes or interface with the composition to implement. We
                        use inheritance or composition to extend the behavior of an object, but this is done at
                        compile-time, and it’s applicable to all the instances of the class. We can’t add any
                        new functionality to remove any existing behavior at runtime – this is when the
                        decorator pattern is useful.</p>

                        different objects in a system. If the objects interact with each other directly, the
                        system components are tightly-coupled with each other which makes maintainability cost
                        higher and not flexible to extend easily. The mediator pattern focuses on providing a
                        mediator between objects for communication and implementing loose-coupling between
                        objects. The mediator works as a router between objects, and it can have its own logic

                        Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose-coupling in software design
                        where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Then
                        the object in the chain will decide who will be processing the request and whether the
                        request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.</p>
                    <p>We know that we can have multiple <code>catch</code> blocks in a <code>try-catch</code>
                        block code. Here every <code>catch</code> block is kind of a processor to process that
                        particular exception. So when an exception occurs in the <code>try</code> block, it’s
                        sent to the first <code>catch</code> block to process. If the <code>catch</code> block
                        is not able to process it, it forwards the request to the next <code>Object</code> in
                        the chain (i.e., the next <code>catch</code> block). If even the last <code>catch</code>
                        block is not able to process it, the exception is thrown outside of the chain to the
                        calling program.</p>

                    <h3>4. Observer Pattern</h3>
                    <p>An observer design pattern is useful when you are interested in the state of an
                        <code>Object</code> and want to get notified whenever there is any change. In the
                        observer pattern, the <code>Object</code> that watches the state of another
                        <code>Object</code> is called <em>observer</em>, and the <code>Object</code> that is
                        being watched is called <em>subject</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Java provides an built-in platform for implementing the observer pattern through the
                        <code>java.util.Observable</code> class and <code>java.util.Observer</code> interface.
                        However, it’s not widely used because the implementation is limited and most of the time
                        we don’t want to end up extending a class solely for implementing the observer pattern
                        as Java doesn’t provide multiple inheritances in classes. Java Message Service (JMS)
                        uses the observer pattern along with the mediator pattern to allow applications to
                        subscribe and publish data to other applications.

                        known as a policy pattern. We define multiple algorithms and let client applications
                        pass the algorithm to be used as a parameter.</p>
                    <p>One of the best examples of this pattern is the <code>Collections.sort()</code> method
                        that takes the Comparator
                        parameter. Based on the different implementations of comparator interfaces, the objects
                        are getting sorted in different ways.</p>

                        the encapsulated <em>command</em> object. The command object passes the request to the
                        appropriate method of <em>receiver</em> to perform the specific action.</p>

                    <h3>7. State Pattern</h3>
                    <p>The state design pattern is used when an <code>Object</code> changes its behavior based
                        on its internal state. If we have to change the behavior of an <code>Object</code> based
                        on its state, we can have a state variable in the <code>Object</code> and use
                        <code>if-else</code> condition block to perform different actions based on the state.
                        The state pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely-coupled way to achieve
                        this through context and state implementations.

                        saved state data of the object is not accessible outside of the <code>Object</code>,
                        this protects the integrity of saved state data.</p>
                    <p>Memento pattern is implemented with two <code>Object</code>s – <em>originator</em> and

                        saved and restored, and it uses an inner class to save the state of <code>Object</code>.
                        The inner class is called “Memento”, and it’s <code>private</code> so that it can’t be
                        accessed from other objects.

                        layer. This way we implement the separation of logic in our application.</p>
